# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- First-class NPU, TPU, AI ASIC, FPGA/adaptive-SoC and decommissioned-accelerator catalog categories.
- Hailo-10H / Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2, SOPHGO BM1688 and BM1684X, Tenstorrent Wormhole n150s, AMD Kria KV260, AMD Versal AI Edge Gen 2, AMD Alveo V70, Google Coral Edge TPU, MemryX MX3 and Intel NCS2 reference entries.
- `docs/ACCELERATORS.md` with workload-routing, TOPS guardrails and accelerator benchmark requirements.
- Reusable `accelerator-research` agent skill.
- Accelerator metadata for family, host mode, software stack, LLM support, lifecycle, precision formats, power scope and workload role.
- Catalog schema v3 support for unresolved/EOL pricing without fake zero-dollar values.
- Modular catalog manifest plus category-sized JSON fragments to reduce merge conflicts as the hardware universe grows.

### Changed

- Screening and BOM code now handles unresolved prices safely.
- LLM screening explicitly excludes TOPS/TFLOPS from the heuristic.
- Fixed-function vision accelerators are cataloged as specialists rather than mislabeled LLM workers.
- Project charter and guardrails now cover accelerator power boundaries, runtime evidence and lifecycle risk.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Expanded project scope from Ryzen laptop-class nodes to heterogeneous mini PCs, development boards, SBCs, embedded boards and specialty compute.
- AMD BC-250 experimental candidate with explicit community-evidence and risk labels.
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super, Orange Pi 5 Plus 32GB, Radxa ROCK 5 ITX+ 32GB, MINISFORUM BD795M, Framework Ryzen AI mainboard and Intel N100 control-plane references.
- Project charter and mechanical guardrails.
- Hardware catalog, benchmark, scoring and agent-workflow specifications.
- Five reusable agent skills for hardware research, catalog curation, benchmarking, architecture review and release governance.
- PR and hardware-candidate templates.
- Mechanical version/document governance check in CI.

### Changed

- Screening score now supports heterogeneous hardware and explicitly avoids CPU-core-based cross-architecture performance claims.
- Parts table now supports Alibaba, AliExpress and manufacturer/reference sources instead of labelling every URL as Alibaba.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Initial low-power distributed LLM cluster architecture.
- Alibaba hardware-market snapshot with prices, URLs, seller verification state and plain-language rationale.
- Ryzen 7 7735U, Ryzen 7 8845HS, Ryzen 7 8745HS and Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 node candidates.
- 2.5GbE switch, DDR5 SO-DIMM and NVMe sourcing leads.
- ASCII architecture, power, networking and model-placement diagrams.
- Machine-readable `data/parts.json` catalog.
- CLI node-ranking and BOM calculations.
- Catalog validation, stale-price checks and generated PARTS.md workflow.
- GitHub Actions validation workflow.
